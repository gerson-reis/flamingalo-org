# Flickets are Live! 🔥🔥

**Our pink flight is booked: May 27–31, 2026**

Yes, we are excited! And you should be too. 🦩✨

## 🎟️ Early Birds Are Here!

Last year, we launched flickets in March, two months before the event 🙃 We are improving! This time, we were able to launch flickets **many months in advance**, giving you plenty of time to plan your journey to Flamingalo 2026.

### Why Get Your Early Bird?

**1. Save Money 💰**

Early bird flickets come at a **discounted price**. The earlier you commit, the more you save. It's our way of saying thank you to those who plan ahead and trust us with their summer plans!

**2. Help Us Build Something Beautiful 🎨**

By getting your flicket early, you're not just securing your spot – you're giving us **strong starting funds** to move the pieces earlier. This means:

- Better infrastructure planning
- More time to coordinate with artists and camps
- Earlier land preparations
- Enhanced facilities and amenities
- A smoother, more organized event

Your early commitment directly helps us create the beautiful Flamingalo experience we all dream of!

**3. Peace of Mind 🧘**

Secure your spot now and relax. No last-minute rushing, no sold-out panic, no FOMO. Just pure excitement building up to May!

## 📅 Important Dates

**Event Dates:** May 27–31, 2026  
**Early Bird Deadline:** End of December 2024  
**Location:** Alentejo, Portugal 🇵🇹

## 🦩 What's Included?

Your flicket gives you access to:

- 5 days of radical self-expression and community
- Access to art installations, theme camps, and workshops
- Basic infrastructure (toilets, first aid, welfare support)
- Participation in a co-created Burning Man regional event
- Memories that will last a lifetime

**Remember:** Flamingalo is a co-created event. We provide the canvas, but you bring the colors! There are no spectators here – only participants.

## 💖 Early Bird Special

**Available until the end of this month!**

We have a limited number of early bird flickets available at a special discount. Once they're gone, prices will increase for the next tier.
